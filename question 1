Prompt the user to enter an integer greater than 1. Your code for this should be type-safe and validate the number, meaning that your code should re-prompt the user for another entry if they enter anything other than an integer that is greater than 1.
Repeatedly square the integer until it exceeds 1 million, outputting the value each time after squaring.
Output the number of squarings required to exceed 1 million.
